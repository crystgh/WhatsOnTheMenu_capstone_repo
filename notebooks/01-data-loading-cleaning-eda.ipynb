    "At first glance, this dataset seems to contain several variables that would be helpful for my project to build a recipe recommendation tool based on ingredients. Some really useful variables for this purpose would be 'title', 'ingredients', 'directions' and 'NER' (Name Entity Recognizer). Other variables contained in this dataset include 'link' which contains the same information as 'directions', but the link takes users to additional features such as printing, e-mailing, saving the recipe. 'source' just tells us how the recipe was gathered.\n",

    "As for the drawbacks of this dataset, this doesn't contain the number of calories, but I can attempt to extract the quantities for different recipes for each ingredient, and map them using a different dataset to extract their nutritional value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation of this dataset is that this method of calculating calories would give us the total calories per recipe, and not necessarily per meal, so I would need to divide the total calories in the recipe by the servings yielded from the recipe. After looking a bit further, it seems that the 'directions' column contains the information on serving sizes, so I can extract the amount of servings that each recipe yields and build a numerical column to divide the total calories by. The only drawback of this approach is that not all of the recipes contain the serving sizes, so for this project I will limit the focus on the subset of recipes that do contain the serving size. Knowing the amount of servings that the recipe yield would still be useful information in case the user is interested in knowing how much food the recipe yields in case they want to make adjustments to the ingredient quantities depending on how much food they want to prepare, which could help with reducing waste shall the recipe yield too much food for their needs."
