## Recipe Recommendation System: What's On The Menu? üçΩÔ∏èüë©‚Äçüç≥


### Executive Summary

**Problem:** Households often face the challenge of managing food resources efficiently. A significant amount of food is wasted due to over purchasing, improper storage, and the inability to use ingredients before they spoil. Also, individuals often struggle to plan meals that make the best use of what they already have, leading to unnecessary expenditure on groceries.

**Solution and Impact:** With data science it is possible to develop a recipe recommendation tool that provides relevant recipe options based on ingredients on hand which helps reduce expenses and food waste.

**Initial Takeaways from Dataset:** The dataset includes mostly text data. In this project I focused on a subset of recipes that include serving sizes. This sample includes 105,543 unique recipes with a total of 5,529 unique ingredients. The average number of ingredients per recipe from this subset is ~8. The top 10 frequent occurring words include: salt, pepper, onion, cheese, cream, sugar, butter, water, chicken, and oil, which are staples commonly found in the kitchen. 

### Demo

### Methodology

**Data processing steps**: The list of changes and actions performed in the original dataset to process the data include: cleaning up missing values and checking for duplicates, extracting the serving size and converting to the same unit of measure (e.g. dozens to single units), calculating a variable containing the number of ingredients in each recipe, and labeling each recipe by meal type (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, dessert, and salads) using .loc method and supervised learning.

**Modelling directions**: The selected model is a content based recommendation model. The vectorizer of choice is Bag of Words (BoW) using CountVectorizer(). The ingredients list in the dataset was tokenized and the resulting sparse matrix was one hot encoded for further use. Additionally, the meal type variable that was engineered previously was encoded and sparsed. The two sparse matrices were then combined to calculate a cosine similarity based on the user inputs: **meal type** and **list of ingredients on hand**. The output of this model include a dataframe containing the top 5 recipes that most closely match the user inputs. The dataframe outputs the recipe name, ingredients list, serving size, instructions, measures and similarity of the top 5 recipes.

**Prototyping directions**: The prototyping direction of choice for showcasing this app is Streamlit, which allows users to interact with it in real time and providing inputs through dropdowns and text boxes. This is really useful for this project since the user input directly affects the recommendations output.

### Taste Tests and What is Next on the Menu?

Dealing with a dataset that was only text without any numerical variables was an interesting and new experience for me. This was both challenging and rewarding. Using this dataset pushed me to be extra creative in terms of how to preprocess the data for EDA and modeling.

In the future, I would like to try additional modeling techniques for text processing such as embeddings and Word2Vec, and compare the recommendations against the current model. I would also like to add an output list of ingredients missing between the user's input and the recipe's ingredients that can serve as a grocery list if the user is missing some of these ingredients in their kitchen. Lastly, I would like to explore appending pictures to recipes which can help as a visual guide for users on what the final recipe output would look like.
